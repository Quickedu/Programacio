# PROGRAMATION FOLDER 
Yes, you read it right, it's a full repo of all the stuff (exercices) I did in half a year of programation (because then I get disciplined and I made one repo for project. And yes, also didn't know how _.gitignore_ worked back then...ðŸ‘»)

Just to clarify, when I say methods, i mean methods or functions .

I'll tell you what each folder has and the purpose of the exercice:
First of all you have (ignoring .vscode) 4 folders.
- Examens (which was the exam we did on november)
- Exercicis (which are the exercices we did on class)
- JO-EL CompeticiÃ³ (which was something I used to practice with to get prepared for Programa-me)
- Teories (which has the notes about methods I took in class)

We are going to focuse on Exercicis folder because that's where all the Magic is. Inside the folder, we can find:
- [1- Programes Basics](/Exercicis/1-%20Programes%20Basics)
- [2- Exercicis abans metodes](/Exercicis/3-%20Exercicis%20metodes)
- [3- Exercicis metodes](/Exercicis/3-%20Exercicis%20metodes)
- [4- Exercicis coleccions](/Exercicis/4-%20Exercicis%20coleccions)
- [5- Programacio objectes basic](/Exercicis/5-%20Programacio%20objectes%20basic)
- [6- Programacio_Objectes](/Exercicis/6-Programacio_Objectes/Inici_Grafics)

In [Programes Basics](/Exercicis/1-%20Programes%20Basics), you have the problems we solved at our firsts lessons when we were learning what is programming and how to do it. It's separated in levels you can found as Programes bÃ sics 1, 2 and 3. Each one, has it's own problems, obviously going from ez to hard as the number gets higher 

In [Exercicis abans metodes](/Exercicis/3-%20Exercicis%20metodes), the thing gets so similar, but it starts with Programes bÃ sics 4 to 7 (there are some copy, because I used them as a resource to teach some of my classmates with it). This are the exercices we were doing before starting with methods (maybe one or two of the programs are with methods, but only because way after I had to use them and I just change the first structure instead of creating a copy...)

In [Exercicis metodes](/Exercicis/3-%20Exercicis%20metodes), we keep the same structure as before, but now we are using methods! Here we learned how to use methods and how they work

In [Programacio objectes basic](/Exercicis/5-%20Programacio%20objectes%20basic), we started working with the objects. We did 3 exercices where we interact with the people ([Orientat a objectes 2](/Exercicis/5-%20Programacio%20objectes%20basic/Orientat%20a%20objectes%202) is a good and cool exercice we did, go check it out ^^)

Finally, in [Programacio_Objectes](/Exercicis/6-Programacio_Objectes/Inici_Grafics) we have the first project we did with Heirloom. The objective of the game was to discover which of the frogs was the princess moving a prince. If you look at my work, you won't be able to find any frog or the prince, because I MADE IT ABOUT MARIO ðŸ˜Ž. My game is that you have to find peach moving mario mounted on yoshi (literally I used the pixelart of my pfp on GitHub), and the frogs are clouds! It's kinda cool, go try it ^^
